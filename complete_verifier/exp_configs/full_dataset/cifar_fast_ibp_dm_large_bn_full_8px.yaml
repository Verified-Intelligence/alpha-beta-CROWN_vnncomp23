# A large model with BN trained with IBP with short warmup (Shi et al., 2021).
# Note that the model can be effectively verify using IBP, but currently our verifier defaults to alpha-CROWN.
# alpha-CROWN is stronger than IBP but can be relatively slow; we will add an IBP shortcut in the next release.
